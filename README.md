## A compiler for the Spaghetti Language

I will be jotting down some ideas here and maybe even writing code!!

### Features (an ad hoc list):

[ ] compiler called with "boil <filename>"
  
[ ] compiled in C  
  
[ ] file extension .spag (or .ghett?) 
  
[ ] loosely OOP, with classes, methods, inheritance 
  
[ ] classes declared with 'dish' 
  
[ ] methods declared with 'recipe'
